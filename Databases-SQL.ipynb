    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database:\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. \n",
    "It is designed to efficiently manage, store, retrieve, and update data. \n",
    "Databases play a crucial role in various applications, from simple data storage to complex systems supporting large-scale web applications and enterprise solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between SQL and NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1.Data Model:\n",
    "  SQL Databases: Follow a fixed schema with a structured, tabular format (tables with rows and columns).\n",
    "  NoSQL Databases: Have a dynamic or schema-less data model, allowing flexibility in storing and handling different types of data.\n",
    "2.Scalability:\n",
    "  SQL Databases: Generally scale vertically (by increasing the power of the hardware), which can have limitations in handling large amounts of data and high traffic.\n",
    "  NoSQL Databases: Typically scale horizontally by adding more servers to the database, making them well-suited for distributed and large-scale applications.\n",
    "3.Query Language:\n",
    "  SQL Databases: Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating the data.\n",
    "  NoSQL Databases: Use various query languages or APIs depending on the type of NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB uses a JSON-like query language).\n",
    "4.Consistency and Transactions:\n",
    "  SQL Databases: Emphasize ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and are often used in scenarios where data consistency is critical.\n",
    "  NoSQL Databases: May prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency (CAP theorem), making them suitable for scenarios where immediate consistency is not a top priority.\n",
    "5.Use Cases:\n",
    "  SQL Databases: Well-suited for applications with complex relationships and structured data, such as traditional relational databases.\n",
    "  NoSQL Databases: Effective for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, often in distributed and scalable environments, like web applications and big data processing."
